# wp-challenge

This is a demo WordPress project used for testing and assessing the candidate ability to problem solve and work around WordPress sites.

## Intro

The goal with this project, is to simulate a real scenario for a project based on WordPress, and ask the candidate to solve a number of tasks that span from Responsive Design to Custom Post Types. The candidate should clone the project and work on a separate branch. At the end all the work done should be pushed to the new branch. The branch name should be in the following format [candidate_name]_[Ymd_date] (example john_20170101).

The candidates must be granted access to the repository at the start of the challenge. 

## Risources
*Design JPEG:* http://clientcenter.lumina.nyc/Garden_Savvy/designs/contact_us/v2.2

*Demo / Wireframe:* https://5tto95.axshare.com/contact.html

## Tasks
### Set Up Locally
The first requirement is to set up the site on the local machine of the candidate.

### Front End
Given the above wireframe as a reference the candidate should proceed to implement a fully responsive solution for the missing parts of the wireframe.

### Back End
The full functionality of form should be implemented using AJAX. The submission should be handled by the default WordPress AJAX endpoint and should enter a new record in a new defined Custom Post Type. The CPT should save the extra details in appositly created custom fields with the Advanced Custom Field plugin.

### Bonus
Indicators for the form being submitted, and successful submission, are not required but are a nice additional touch.
