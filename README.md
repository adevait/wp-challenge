# wp-challenge

This is a demo WordPress project used for testing and assessing the candidate ability to problem solve and work around WordPress sites.

## Intro

The goal with this project, is to simulate a real scenario for a project based on WordPress, and ask the candidate to solve a number of tasks that span from Responsive Design to Custom Post Types. The candidate should clone the project and work on a separate branch. At the end all the work done should be pushed to the new branch. The branch name should be in the following format [candidate_name]_[Ymd_date] (example john_20170101).

The candidates must be granted access to the repository at the start of the challenge. 

## Tasks

*Set Up Locally*

The first requirement is to set up the site on the local machine of the candidate.

*Front End*

Given the following wireframe as a reference [https://5tto95.axshare.com/contact.html] the candidate should proceed to implement a fully responsive solution for the missing parts of the wireframe.

*Back End*

The full functionality of form should be implemented using AJAX. The submission should be handled by the default WordPress AJAX endpoint and should enter a new record in a new defined Custom Post Type. The CPT should save the extra details in appositly created custom fields with the Advanced Custom Field plugin.

*Bonus*

Indicators for the form being submitted, and successful submission, are not required but are a nice additional touch.

## Notes

The candidate is free to use the net to search for solutions, it's a real case scenario and internet is always there to help with that, so go on and use it. 

In case of technical issues, feel free to contact us to help you solve the issue, that's also a real scenario, we value the team work here, and asking for help when stuck in a place is deffinitly something we approve.
